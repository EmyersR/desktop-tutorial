# GRO-seq Alignment and eRNA Analysis

**Author:** Eva Myers  
**Institution:** Austin College – Department of Biology and Biochemistry  
**Project Type:** Computational Gene Regulation Analysis (GRO-seq)

---

## Overview
This repository contains alignment, quality control, and expression analysis files for GRO-seq data comparing **MCF7 (breast cancer)** and **MCF10A (non-tumorigenic breast epithelial)** cell lines.  
The objective is to identify **enhancer RNA (eRNA)** transcriptional activity and assess differential regulatory patterns between cancerous and normal cell states.
